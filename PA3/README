---Folders---
handout - Assignment description and documentation

---Executables---
./testscript - A simple bash script for running a few sample test cases
./pi-sched - A simple program for statistically calculating pi using
             a specific scheduling policy

---Notes---
Be sure to call "make clean" after running rw or mixed otherwise your folder will get
cluttered with many unnecessary output files.

 make

Clean:
 make clean 
 make testclean
