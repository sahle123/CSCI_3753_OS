Notes:


1.) To use testscript: "sudo ./testscript" 
		- Stores all values in test_ouput folder
		- To clean folder "make testclean"
		- All objects and executables will be cleaned

2.) All programs have 3 parameters: 
		argv[1] = policy
		argv[2] = number of processes
		argv[3] = show results (default No)

3.) pi-sched.c is the CPU bound program.
		- To run, "sudo ./pi-sched <schedule> <process limit> <results?>"

4.) rw.c is the I/O-bound program.
		- When rw has finished running, make sure to call "make clean" to remove
		all the excess output files.
		- To run, "sudo ./rw <schedule> <process limit> <results?>"

5.) mixed.c is the CPU and I/O bound program.
		- Same as rw, need to call "make clean" after done.
		- To run, "sudo ./mixed <schedule> <process limit> <results?>"
